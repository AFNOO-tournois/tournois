## What Happens Without Logos?

- ❌ Header will show broken image icon
- ❌ Footer will show broken image icon
- ❌ Favicon won't display
- ✅ All other features work perfectly!

## How to Add Logos

1. Download the logo files from Le Centre Franco
2. Rename them to:
   - `logo-only.png`
   - `logo-full.png`
3. Place them in this folder (`assets/images/`)
4. Refresh your website - logos will appear!

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Text

If you can't get logos right away, you can temporarily:
1. Open `index.html`, `signup.html`, `bracket.html`, `results.html`, and `admin.html`
2. Find the `<img>` tags with `src="assets/images/logo-*.png"`
3. Replace with text (e.g., `<h1>Le Centre franco</h1>`)
4. Add proper logos later

**Status**: ⚠️ Logo files need to be added before deployment
